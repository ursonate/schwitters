#this is sort of a readme file
#i don't know what i'm doing.

so this really strange thing happened
i started poking around on github
not really knowing what i was doing
I'm sure other products do some things differently.
But is the plumbing all the same?



hey i'm adding stuff
it's a whole new world
oh, hello world

I think that would be healthy for us all.

if we fed it into a convolutional neural network
it's been a long, long time since i've made a change
